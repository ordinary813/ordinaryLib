1. Thread.run() vs. Thread.start()
thread.start prompts jvm that another thread is supposed to be exectued soon, it doesnt necessarily start running the thread.
thread.run runs the run() function (which is originally empty).

EXPLANATION

2.3
the program would wait for each thread in order of calling them in the second loop, essentially running and waiting for each thread.

2.4
calling Thread.currentThread().join() will make us wait for the current thread running to finish running (static method so doesn't matter from what object we called it).
